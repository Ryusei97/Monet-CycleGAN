# Monet-CycleGAN
A python notebook for the "Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself" challenge on Kaggle.com. This is an image generation / style transfer project. Our objective is to create 7000 Monet-esque images. We have access to 300 Monet paintings and more than 7000 regular photographs. We can either generate Monet-esque photos from scratch or transfer the style onto the photo dataset. I will be transferring the style for this project using GANs.
